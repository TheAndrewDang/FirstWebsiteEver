        <h2>Welcome To My Blog!</h2>
        <h4><u>Assignment 1</u></h4>
        <p>I spent a few hours on this assignment and I have learned alot of styling techniques. Whenever I got stuck my first go to is W3Schools. They usually have a very quick
            and simple solution to my problems with a fast explanation. I already know how to work with the basics of HTML but I needed to work alot more on CSS. So far my resources
            have been my teammates, StackOverflow, and W3Schools.
        </p>
        <h4><u>Assignment 2</u></h4>
        <p>So I have spent the whole two weeks working on this project. Probably a total of 30-40 hours spent on just researching on what I need to do. This weeks assignment taught me alot
            of useful stuff like how to use Flexbox. There is still alot to learn about Flexbox but so far the process is getting there. We are starting to learn JavaScript and I cannot wait 
            to incorporate that to my page and see what I can do from there.
        </p>
        <h4><u>Assignment 3</u></h4>
        <p>This week was quite difficult. There was alot of trial and error when using javascript and alot of googling to find the answers that I want. I did find that there was a bunch of specifics
            that I had to spend over 15-20 hours just working on this assignment alone. I did not understand alot of stuff and I personally believe that the lecture did not have all the content that I needed
            to get this assignment done. But I guess this is training us to become real web developers as we will not usually have a perfect YouTube video for everything.
        </p>
        <h4><u>Assignment 4</u></h4>
        <p>This week was not so bad I eneded up getting everything done pretty quickly and timely. Some minor hickups with typos but other than that I watched the lectures and pretty much went with the project.
        </p>
        <h4><u>Assignment 5</u></h4>
        <p>Another difficult project for sure. Not only was this one extremely time consuming but also hard to udnderstand in my head. I ran into alot of server problems and issues with getting anything to go to the DOM
            . In addition to that there was alot of diffulty trying to find information online that I found any bit helpful towards this project what so ever which made it even more difficult. This week felt like learning a whole
            different language.
